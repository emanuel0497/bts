Now greetings to the world
Vice ala one big gong zilla ‘longside skrillex
And for long!
Oh wait
I won’t!
We mash up the place, turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
Ah we-a blaze the fyah, make it bun dem!

We mash up the place, turn up the bass
And make some sound why run
And we will end your week, just like a sunday!
We mash up the place, turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
Skrillex-ah blaze the fire, make it bun dem!
We mash up the place, turn up the bass
And make some sound why run
And we will end your week, just like a sunday!

Rudeboy!

If a nuh pose, but if I suppose
Dem fool yah cuz dem wouldn’t stop hose
Yuh killin' the floors we see zion mus'
They kickin’ the floor nah we let dah moles in
Never yet falter, never yet laugh, never yet alter, never yet sof'
Keep up yuh guard and never yet drop
All dem a talk and all dem a chat

Skrillex and gong
The legend lives on
We give dem it hard, we give dem it strong
We give dem it rough, we give dem it long
We give dem it right and never yet wrong
Sweeter the victory, the hotter the battle
The bigger the cover the fatter the bottle
The place haffi rattle, a my tabernacle dis

Rudeboy bass, mash up da place!
